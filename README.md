# Triton
Just another game engine that I am coding for fun in my spare time

*NOTE:* The engine is in a very early state of development and currently doesn't support many features, but I am actively developing it


# Features I would like to implement
* ~~Basic editor~~
* Text rendering
* Sound engine
* Shadows
* Texture mapping (Alpha, bump, specular, ect...)
* Reflection
* Particle system
* Picking
* Physics based rendering
* OpenGL support
* Scripting support
* Serialization

# *Tests projects*

**You can find test projects in the test projects folder (https://github.com/nfwGytautas/Triton/tree/master/Test%20projects)**

*Note: Some projects are not fleshed out and might only work in certain circumstances, this is because these projects are created for the purpose of testing specific features of the engine and not to create a game or any other application*
* Rubik's cube **Triton version: 000a** (Created for object rotation, simple model creation and event system testing)
* Mario (sort of) **Triton version: 001a** (Created for texture loading and python embedding, EnTT integration and simple material testing)
* Scene **Triton version: 002a** (Created for testing mesh loading, multiple lighting, render chain and serialization)
