# Triton
Just another game engine that I am coding for fun in my spare time

*NOTE:* The engine is in a very early state of development and currently doesn't support many features, but I am actively developing it


# Features I would like to implement
* Basic editor
* Text rendering
* Sound engine
* Shadows
* Texture mapping (Alpha, bump, specular, ect...)
* Reflection
* Particle system
* Picking
* Physics based rendering
* OpenGL support
* Scripting support
* Serialization

The engine uses various third party libraries all of them can be found inside the vendor folder
