# Features I would like to implement
* Basic editor
* ~~Text rendering~~

* Shadows
* ~~Texture mapping (Alpha, bump, specular, ect...)~~
* Reflection
* Particle system
* High dynamic based lighting
* Physics based rendering

The engine uses various third party libraries all of them can be found inside the vendor folder
